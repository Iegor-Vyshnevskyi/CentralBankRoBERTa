In this folder, you find: 

1. The raw data for BIS, ECB, FED speeches in /BIS, /ECB, /FED. These speeches have been scraped from their respective websites. 

2. The Pre_Processed datasets. These have parsed the raw input speeches and parsed them into sentences, removed punctuation and removed common redundant strings that stem from PDF scans.
The script with which the pre-processing was done ('Pre_Processing.ipynb') is also in this folder.
