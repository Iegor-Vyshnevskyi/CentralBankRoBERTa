This folder contains the script for the creation of Pseudolabels. Pseudo-labelling is the process of adding confident predicted test data to training data (Riloff [1996](https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/1996/AAAI96-155.pdf); Lee [2013](https://github.com/emintham/Papers/blob/master/Lee-%20Pseudo-Label:%20The%20Simple%20and%20Efficient%20Semi-Supervised%20Learning%20Method%20for%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks.pdf)). 

We have created two additional datasets of pseudo-labels from the BIS and ECB datasets for each classifier. To further fine-tune our economic agent classifier, only additional pseudo-labels for economic agents with a high confidence threshold were used. A lower threshold of 77% for the BIS and 79% for the ECB was applied. As a result, 4,804 additional labels were created for the BIS and 4,051 for the ECB.
